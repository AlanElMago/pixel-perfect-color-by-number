## Description
Pixel Perfect - Color by Number is an open source project that attempts to mimic the popular mobile game Pixel Art - Color by Number. The game is a simple color by number game where the player is presented with a grid of numbers and each number corresponds to a color. The player must fill in the grid with the correct colors to reveal a hidden picture. The game is designed to be relaxing and stress-free.

## Features
- Random grid generation (1x1 to 200x200)
- Random palette generation (1 to 20 colors)
- Panning and zooming

## Installation/Set-up
There is currently no straightforward way to install the game. However, you can clone the repository and play the game by running a local server (I use the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code). Compile the TypeScript files using the `tsc` command. The compiled JavaScript files will be located in a folder called `dist`. The entry point for the game is `index.html`.

Update: I have added a live demo of the game. You can play the game by visiting the following link: [Pixel Perfect - Color by Number](https://pixel-perfect-color-by-number.vercel.app/)

# How to Play
- Hold left click and drag on the grid to paint.
- Hold right click and drag on the grid to pan.
- Scroll on the grid to zoom in and out.
- Left click on a color in the palette tray to select it.
- Hold left click and drag on the palette tray to scroll through the colors (if the palette is larger than the tray).
